# Getting Started with WebMod - Part 1

To start, make sure you have the WebMod extension installed on your favorite Chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge) [Install in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webmod/hihllohgkcmdkkiafjecnlepkcoaahfc/)

1. Open the WebMod editor by clicking the icon in the extensions menu in your browser.
2. Decide the website you would like to mod. In this tutorial we will use google.com.
3. In the WebMod editor, add this into the editor:
```
if(window.location.href == "https://www.google.com/"){
  console.log("yup")
  let logo = document.getElementById("hplogo");
  logo.src = "https://img.funnytab.net/gallery/google/Google_Logo_Examine_Eyes.jpg";
  logo.srcset = "https://img.funnytab.net/gallery/google/Google_Logo_Examine_Eyes.jpg";
  }
  ```
4. Click Save
5. Now, if you reload Google.com, you should see this:
